# Prompts for Further Development via LLM

The following prompts can be provided to an advanced language model to identify improvements, disruptive innovations, or fixes for `assistant_server.py`.

1. **Security Hardening**
   - "Review the `assistant_server.py` code and suggest comprehensive improvements to secure the API against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, brute force attacks). Provide detailed code examples."

2. **OCR Accuracy Enhancements**
   - "Analyze the current OCR approach using `pytesseract` and `easyocr`. Propose optimized techniques or configurations to maximize accuracy and reduce latency."

3. **Scalability and Deployment**
   - "Design a scalable deployment strategy for the Flask API, considering containerization, orchestration, and monitoring. Outline the required code or configuration changes."

4. **Advanced GTO Matching**
   - "Suggest algorithms or data structures to improve the `get_gto_advice` function so it can handle complex game states and provide real-time advice with minimal latency."

5. **Extensibility**
   - "Identify sections of the code that would benefit from refactoring into separate modules or classes, enhancing maintainability. Provide example structures."

6. **Testing Strategy**
   - "Create a detailed plan for unit and integration tests for each function in `assistant_server.py`. Include mock inputs and expected outputs."
